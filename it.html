    <h1>History Of The New York State Flower</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    <h3>Before the rose flower was officially adopted as the New Yorkâ€™s official state flower, it took various
        considerations. For instance, the New York school children were asked to vote for a state flower in 1890,
        however, the legislative body never announced the results. The New York legislature was keen on selecting the
        most suitable plant that could last, and after serious deliberations, they settled on the use of the rose flower
        as the state flower. Roses are also known to do exceptionally well in New York City making it a great choice for
        the state flower. Three different species of roses are grown in New York City. They have been classified
        depending on the habitat and breeding. Some of the common species of roses grown in this city include old roses,
        modern shrub, climbers and ramblers, hybrid tea roses, and miniature roses.</h3>
