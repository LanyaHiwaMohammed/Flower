    <h3>In Ayurvedic medicine, the golden shower tree is known as aragvadha, meaning "disease killer". The fruit pulp is
        considered a purgative,[15][16] and self-medication or any use without medical supervision is strongly advised
        against in Ayurvedic texts. Though it has been used in herbalism for millennia, little research has been
        conducted in modern times, although it is an ingredient in some mass-produced herbal laxatives. When used as
        such, it is known as "cassia pods".[7]
        In India, a cathartic made from the pulp is sometimes added to tobacco.[17]
        A paste of the flowers is used as an ointment for pimples</h3>
