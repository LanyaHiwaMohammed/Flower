    <h3>Cassia fistula is both the national tree and national flower of Thailand – in Thai ratchaphruek (Thai: ราชพฤกษ์)
        and the blossoms commonly referred to as dok khun (Thai: ดอกคูน).[18] Its yellow flowers symbolize Thai royalty.
        A 2006–2007 flower festival, the Royal Flora Ratchaphruek, was named after the tree. Cassia fistula is also
        featured on a 2003 joint Canadian-Thai design for a 48-cent stamp, part of a series featuring national
        emblems.[10]

        The Indian laburnum is the state flower of Kerala. The flowers are of ritual importance in preparation of Kani
        during the Vishu festival of Kerala[19] which falls in the month of April.The tree has been depicted on a
        20-rupee stamp.

        The tree is frequently cultivated in Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka where the Sinhala name is Ehela, ඇහැල.[20]

        In Laos, its blooming flowers known locally as dok khoun are associated with the Lao New Year. People use the
        flowers as offerings at the temple and also hang them in their homes for the New Year in belief that the flowers
        will bring happiness and good luck to the households.[21]

        The laburnum is the school tree of National Taiwan Normal University, thought to be because of the seed pods'
        similarity to the whips used by teachers in times past.[22]</h3>
