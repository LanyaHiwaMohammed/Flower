    <h1>What Is The Official State Flower Of Wisconsin?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    <h3>The state flower of Wisconsin is the wood violet, also known as the common blue violet or the Viola sororia. The
        Superintendent of Public Instruction in the state, C.P. Cary, decided that the school children will select the
        state’s flower in two phases after he realized that Wisconsin had no official flower. The first open referendum
        was held in 1908 on the Arbor Day, and four finalists were selected: the wild rose, white water lily, wood
        violet, and the arbutus. The final referendum was held in 1909, and the wood violet won with over 67,178 votes
        followed by the wild rose (31,024).

        The wood violet remained the unofficial state flower of Wisconsin until 1948, when the Youth Committee of the
        state’s Centennial Commission discovered that the wood flower had not been officially adopted. Therefore a bill
        was drafted and presented to the Wisconsin legislature. The bill was approved and signed into law on June 4,
        1949, making the wood violet the state’s official flower. Wood violet is famous in the eastern parts of the
        country and its blossoms from March to June. It thrives in all but four of Wisconsin’s counties. It is also the
        state flower of Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Illinois.

        The wood violet is a perennial plant with purple flowers and many heart-shaped leaves. Most wood violets can
        attain a maximum height of about 5 inches. The flowers of the wood violet develop on stalks that don’t have
        leaves. The flowers are made up of five petals which are either blue or violet. The lower petals are separated
        by a broad petal where the pollinators land. The base of the lateral petals is hairy. The presence of these
        flowers signifies the beginning of the long-awaited spring to the locals. The violet flowers start to appear in
        the woodlands as soon as March. It also grows on the riverbeds, under trees, and along the roadsides.</h3>
