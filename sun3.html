    <h1>Hybrids and cultivars</h1>

    <h3>In today's market, most of the sunflower seeds provided or grown by farmers are hybrids. Hybrids or hybridized
        sunflowers are produced by cross-breeding different types and species, for example cultivated sunflowers with
        wild species. By doing so, new genetic recombinations are obtained ultimately leading to the production of new
        hybrid species. These hybrid species generally have a higher fitness and carry properties or characteristics
        that farmers look for, such as resistance to pathogens.[26]

        Hybrid, Helianthus annuus dwarf2 does not contain the hormone gibberellin and does not display heliotropic
        behavior. Plants treated with an external application of the hormone display a temporary restoration of
        elongation growth patterns. This growth pattern diminished by 35% 7â€“14 days after final treatment.[9]

        Hybrid male sterile and male fertile flowers that display heterogeneity have a low crossover of honeybee
        visitation. Sensory cues such as pollen odor, diameter of seed head, and height may influence pollinator
        visitation of pollinators that display constancy behavior patterns.[42]

        Sunflowers are grown as ornamentals in a domestic setting. Being easy to grow and producing spectacular results
        in any good, moist soil in full sun, they are a favourite subject for children. A large number of cultivars, of
        varying size and color, are now available to grow from seed. The following are cultivars of sunflowers (those
        marked agm have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit):-[43]</h3>
