    <p>The common sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is a species of large annual forb of the genus Helianthus. It is
        commonly grown as a crop for its edible oily seeds. Apart from cooking oil production, it is also used as
        livestock forage (as a meal or a silage plant), as bird food, in some industrial applications, and as an
        ornamental in domestic gardens. Wild H. annuus is a widely branched annual plant with many flower heads. The
        domestic sunflower, however, often possesses only a single large inflorescence (flower head) atop an unbranched
        stem.
        Helianthus annuus (common sunflower) belong to the dicotyledonous category, distinguishing them from monocots.
        As dicots, sunflowers possess embryos with two veins, known as cotyledons, a characteristic feature that sets
        them apart. The veins in their leaves exhibit a net-like pattern, in contrast to monocots, which typically
        display parallel leaf veins.</p>
