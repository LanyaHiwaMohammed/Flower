    <h1>Heliotropism</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    <h3>A common misconception is that flowering sunflower heads track the Sun across the sky. Although immature flower
        buds exhibit this behaviour, the mature flowering heads point in a fixed (and typically easterly) direction
        throughout the day.[5][6] This old misconception was disputed in 1597 by the English botanist John Gerard, who
        grew sunflowers in his famous herbal garden: "[some] have reported it to turn with the Sun, the which I could
        never observe, although I have endeavored to find out the truth of it."[7] The uniform alignment of sunflower
        heads in a field might give some people the false impression that the flowers are tracking the Sun.

        This alignment results from heliotropism in an earlier development stage, the young flower stage, before full
        maturity of flower heads (anthesis).[8] Young sunflowers orient themselves in the direction of the sun. At dawn
        the head of the flower faces east and moves west throughout the day. When sunflowers reach full maturity they no
        longer follow the sun, and continuously face east. Young flowers reorient overnight to face east in anticipation
        of the morning. Their heliotropic motion is a circadian rhythm, synchronized by the sun, which continues if the
        sun disappears on cloudy days or if plants are moved to constant light.[9] They are able to regulate their
        circadian rhythm in response to the blue-light emitted by a light source.[9] If a sunflower plant in the bud
        stage is rotated 180Â°, the bud will be turning away from the sun for a few days, as resynchronization with the
        sun takes time.[10]

        When growth of the flower stalk stops and the flower is mature, the heliotropism also stops and the flower faces
        east from that moment onward. This eastward orientation allows rapid warming in the morning and, as a result, an
        increase in pollinator visits.[9] Sunflowers do not have a pulvinus below their inflorescence. A pulvinus is a
        flexible segment in the leaf stalks (petiole) of some plant species and functions as a 'joint'. It effectuates
        leaf motion due to reversible changes in turgor pressure, which occurs without growth. The sensitive plant's
        closing leaves are a good example of reversible leaf movement via pulvinuli.</h3>
