    <h1>Floret arrangement</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    <h3>Generally, each floret is oriented toward the next by approximately the golden angle, 137.5°, producing a
        pattern of interconnecting spirals, where the number of left spirals and the number of right spirals are
        successive Fibonacci numbers. Typically, there are 34 spirals in one direction and 55 in the other; however, in
        a very large sunflower head there could be 89 in one direction and 144 in the other.[11][12][13] This pattern
        produces the most efficient packing of seeds mathematically possible within the flower head.[14][15][16]

        A model for the pattern of florets in the head of a sunflower was proposed by H. Vogel in 1979.[17] This is
        expressed in polar coordinates
        {\displaystyle \theta =n\times 137.5^{\circ },}
        where θ is the angle, r is the radius or distance from the center, and n is the index number of the floret and c
        is a constant scaling factor. It is a form of Fermat's spiral. The angle 137.5° is related to the golden ratio
        (55/144 of a circular angle, where 55 and 144 are Fibonacci numbers) and gives a close packing of florets. This
        model has been used to produce computer generated representations of sunflowers.[18]</h3>
