    <h1>Uses For The Rose</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    <h3>The rose flowers are also characterized by their sweet aroma, and they are mainly used to signify love. They are
        sold mostly in New York by online florists who deliver as requested. The petals of this plant are also edible.
        Since its discovery, the rose plant has also been used for medicinal purposes. Wild birds and other animals
        mostly eat the fruit of the rose flower plat, which is generally referred to as the rosehip during winter.
        Therefore, when planting this flower, it is essential to take caution of these animals and birds as they can
        destroy the entire farm. </h3>
