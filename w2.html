    <h3>Other than being used as the garden and lawn plant in the state, the wood violet has been historically used for
        its medicinal value. Its edible leaves and flowers which have been consumed for centuries are rich in vitamin A
        and C. Its tasty leaves can be used in jellies, candies, and salads. The Cherokee used the plant to treat
        headaches and colds while other native tribes used it to cure constipation, sore throats, and coughs.</h3>
